# .mxtsessions file format

## Introduction

This document tries to give a description of the .mxtsession files used in the proprietary software MobaXterm.
Sadly this format, as efficient as it is, is too obscure to encourage legitimate use cases of this format as there is no public documentation available.

The software licence of MobaXterm, for both Home and Pro editions, allows to *"observe, study or test the functioning of the Software in order to determine the ideas and principles which are the basis of the Software, when performing the loading, display, execution, transmission or storage of the Software"* and this study has been done in full under those terms.

The studied format is the one of version 23.6: sessions last modified (but not necessarily exported) before this version will have fewer fields.

## Projects

If your project uses the information shared here feel free to talk about it in the comments, and I'll add it to the list.

PHP Libraries:
 - [Sessionator, by myself](https://github.com/Ruzgfpegk/sessionator/) allows to compose session files from PHP by building connection objects and exporting them all at once to different formats (MobaXterm being the first one).
   This library is used by a relatively large hosting company in Europe to reduce the time needed to connect to their thousands of managed servers (many of them having their own specific "connection pathways").

Utilities:
- [mobaConverterGo, by dbauer23](https://github.com/dbauer23/mobaConverterGo) converts .mxtsessions files to JSON and vice-versa, which is useful for some [jq manipulation magic](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/tutorial/).

## Overall format

.mxtsessions files follow the INI format, using a Windows-1252/CP1252 charset and Windows (CR LF) line delimiters: it can be tested by using the "Euro" â‚¬ character in a session title.
Which means that Unicode characters can't be used anywhere, especially in session names and comments, and will need to be transformed if present in some source data.

They're basically an extract of all "Bookmarks" sections from the "main" %APPDATA%/MobaXterm/MobaXterm.ini configuration file (or the MobaXterm.ini file next to MobaXterm.exe if you run a Portable version).

Their content is roughly the same whether they are :

* a full export (right-click on "User sessions" and click "Export all sessions to file"),
* a partial export (right-click on a session folder and click "Export sessions from this folder"),
* a "Shared" export (right-click on a session folder or at the root folder and click "Share these sessions with my team").

### Folders

A full or "fully shared" export starts with:

```ini
[Bookmarks]
SubRep=
ImgNum=42
```

Being the main folder, SubRep ("sub-repertory") is empty (the name is forced to "User sessions" by the software) and ImgNum is 42 (icon of a folder with a person above it): this icon cannot be changed in the software.
Following those two properties are the sessions saved under the folder, one per line (see section below).

A partial or "partially shared" export starts with:

```ini
[Bookmarks]
SubRep=The folder selected for export
ImgNum=41
```

Here ImgNum will be whatever it was set to prior to the export, but SubRep will be the name of the "root partial folder".

Sub-folders follow this naming convention:

```ini
[Bookmarks_1]
SubRep=Subfolder name
ImgNum=41
```

In this case, "SubRep" needs to be filled with the directory name that would be displayed on-screen.
The default ImgNum is the empty blue folder (icon ID 41).

The number after "Bookmarks_" indicates the placement order on-screen, from top to bottom.

Sub-sub-folders have a "SubRep" property like "Folder1\\Folder2", with as many sub-folders as necessary.

#### Annotated list of folder icons

The icons in the following screenshot are the property of MOBATEK SARL.

### Sessions

Session lines looks like this:

```ini
Reference Session= #109#0%localhost%22%<default>%%-1%-1%%%%%0%0%0%%%-1%0%0%0%%1080%%0%0%1%%0%%%%0%-1%-1%0#MobaFont%10%0%0%-1%15%236,236,236%30,30,30%180,180,192%0%-1%0%%xterm%-1%0%_Std_Colors_0_%80%24%0%0%-1%<none>%%0%0%-1%-1#0# #-1
Deck=#109#0%192.168.137.40%22%deck%%0%0%%%%%0%0%0%%%-1%0%0%0%%1080%%0%0%1%#MobaFont%10%0%0%-1%15%236,236,236%30,30,30%180,180,192%0%-1%0%%xterm%-1%0%_Std_Colors_0_%80%24%0%1%-1%<none>%%0%0%-1%-1#0# #-1
```

If you export a session (Right click -> "Save session to file") you'll get a .moba file containing only one session line.

The value is the session name, and can contain spaces.

The property is an ordered list, separated by the '#' character, of session characteristics, and some of them can contain a second dimension of characteristics separated by the '%' character.
The number of session characteristics in a line or parent characteristic depend on the version under which the session was last saved: it is assumed that new versions of the software add new characteristic indexes while some older ones (among the unidentified ones) may become ignored.

#### SSH Session lines

By comparing sessions with a changed parameter against a reference session, the full list has been identified as:

1. "`;  logout`" if "Display reconnection message" is unchecked in "Bookmark settings", empty if it's checked.

2. The icon number of the session (see list below) (the default for SSH is 109)

3. The first group of session characteristics, separated by the '%' character (quotes indicate literal strings or numbers):

#### RDP Session lines

By comparing sessions with a changed parameter against a reference session, the full list has been identified as:

1. "`;  logout`" if "Display reconnection message" is unchecked in "Bookmark settings", empty if it's checked.

2. The icon number of the session (see list below) (the default for RDP is 91)

3. The first group of session characteristics, separated by the '%' character (quotes indicate literal strings or numbers):

5. Start session in: "0" for "Normal tab" (default), "1" for "Detached tab", "2" for "Maximized detached tab", "3" for "Fullscreen".

6. The "Comments" field: empty if empty (default), else the comment with any '#' changed to "`__DIEZE__`", no `%` is allowed in the field.

7. Custom tab color: "-1" if unchecked (default), if checked the decimal value of the RGB color ("536870911" for the default color (whitish), "0" for black, "255" for pure red, "65280" for pure green, "16711680" for pure blue)

#### VNC Session lines

By comparing sessions with a changed parameter against a reference session, the full list has been identified as:

1. "`;  logout`" if "Display reconnection message" is unchecked in "Bookmark settings", empty if it's checked.

2. The icon number of the session (see list below) (the default for VNC is 128)

3. The first group of session characteristics, separated by the '%' character (quotes indicate literal strings or numbers):

4. The second group of session characteristics, separated by the '%' character, is identical to the SSH one but only the "Lock terminal title" (index 14) is used in SFTP:

5. Start session in: "0" for "Normal tab" (default), "1" for "Detached tab", "2" for "Maximized detached tab", "3" for "Fullscreen".

6. The "Comments" field: empty if empty (default), else the comment with any '#' changed to "`__DIEZE__`", no `%` is allowed in the field.

7. Custom tab color: "-1" if unchecked (default), if checked the decimal value of the RGB color ("536870911" for the default color (whitish), "0" for black, "255" for pure red, "65280" for pure green, "16711680" for pure blue)

#### Browser Session lines

By comparing sessions with a changed parameter against a reference session, the full list has been identified as:

1. "`;  logout`" if "Display reconnection message" is unchecked in "Bookmark settings", empty if it's checked.

2. The icon number of the session (see list below) (the default for Browser is 313)

3. The first group of session characteristics, separated by the '%' character (quotes indicate literal strings or numbers):
